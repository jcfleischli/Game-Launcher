# Game-Launcher
Reason for project:To control the users logging into a private server by checking that they have not edited any files. Also, checks login before giving them access to the game.

Reason for repository: To showcase my project.

What does it do: Checks the users login credentials, then compares MD5Hash of files for security reasons and replace if necessary. Once all files are updated. Allows the user to launch the game.
